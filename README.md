N. M. Rothschild & Sons Limited of London had established a solid footing in Singapore and was waiting for the right time and opportunity to invest in Malaysia (Shakila Yacob, 2007a). The company came to Malaysia when Tun Abdul Razak, Malaysia’s second prime minister (1971–76) entrusted Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, Chairman of PERNAS (1970–74), to lead several initiatives to help boost Malaysia’s economic growth, including setting up Bank Bumiputra Berhad. In 1972, Tun Ismail Ali, governor of Malaysia’s Central Bank (1962–80, and PNB's chairman, 1978-96), and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild worked together to establish Bumiputra Merchant Bankers, a joint venture between Bank Bumiputra and Rothputra Nominees (a subsidiary of N. M. Rothschild & Sons Limited)—a rare occurrence where the British company agreed to be the minority shareholder (Shakila Yacob and White, 2010, p. 36).

#! The elements of D4 are technically not elements of S4 (they are symmetries of the square, not permutations of four things) so they cannot be a subgroup of S4, but instead they correspond to eight elements of S4 which form a subgroup of S4.
  As for Orangutan, this funny name appeared after the game between Tartakower and Maróczy played in 1924. The day before this game the chess players visited a zoo where Tartakower asked (as a joke) an Orangutan called Suzanna what first move he should play in the coming chess battle. Some people on the Internet assume this is a rare picture of that very orangutan Tartakower and  Maróczy met in the zoo:
