Raub, Pahang and the Aussies
Although Wan Ahmad's eventual victory in 1863 led to his proclamation as sultan and the formation of the modern Pahang sultanate, the Pahang economy, by then, was in shambles. In the decade that followed, the British abandoned their non-intervention stance in order to protect important colonial interests in the state. By October 1888, Sultan Ahmad reluctantly accepted John Pickersgill Rodger as Pahang's first British resident.

Carlos Marcello is the latest event in a long series of  prosecutions of Marcello by federal authorities. See
e. g.
, Marcello v. UnitedStates, 196 F.2d 437 (CA5 1952). All these prosecutions ended in dismissal of charges by the Government or acquittal except a conviction of illegal transfer of marihuana in 1938 and the present case in which Marcello was convicted in1968 of assaulting an FBI agent in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 111. Thisconviction was affirmed on appeal, 423 F.2d 993 (CA5 1970), and this Courtdenied certiorari. 398 U.S. 959, 90 S.Ct. 2172, 26 L.Ed.2d 543. In June 1970,Marcello filed a motion for a new trial, alleging that the Governmentsuppressed evidence which he was entitled to present to the jury that convictedhim. In August 1970, Marcello sought a hearing under 28 U.S.C. § 2255alleging that the chief government witness had perjured himself. Both motionswere denied, and Marcello's appeals from these orders are now pending in theCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Court of standi ( for profit )

... Another known Japanese doctor was Takeshiro Nishimura who opened his clinic in Singapore in 1902 and he became notable for treating Malay royalty. Nishimura became president of the Japanese Association in 1934 (Shimizu 1997;Shimizu and Hirakawa 1999). 2 Research thus far has not uncovered any association between the Andō brothers and the prostitution-linked medical practice characteristic of earlier Japanese doctors who had migrated to Malaya. ...

N. M. Rothschild & Sons Limited of London had established a solid footing in Singapore and was waiting for the right time and opportunity to invest in Malaysia (Shakila Yacob, 2007a). The company came to Malaysia when Tun Abdul Razak, Malaysia’s second prime minister (1971–76) entrusted Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, Chairman of PERNAS (1970–74), to lead several initiatives to help boost Malaysia’s economic growth, including setting up Bank Bumiputra Berhad. In 1972, Tun Ismail Ali, governor of Malaysia’s Central Bank (1962–80, and PNB's chairman, 1978-96), and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild worked together to establish Bumiputra Merchant Bankers, a joint venture between Bank Bumiputra and Rothputra Nominees (a subsidiary of N. M. Rothschild & Sons Limited)—a rare occurrence where the British company agreed to be the minority shareholder (Shakila Yacob and White, 2010, p. 36).

  As for Orangutan, this funny name appeared after the game between Tartakower and Maróczy played in 1924. The day before this game the chess players visited a zoo where Tartakower asked (as a joke) an Orangutan called Suzanna what first move he should play in the coming chess battle. Some people on the Internet assume this is a rare picture of that very orangutan Tartakower and  Maróczy met in the zoo:
